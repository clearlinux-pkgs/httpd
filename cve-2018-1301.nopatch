# low: Possible out of bound access after failure in reading the HTTP request
# (CVE-2018-1301) 
#
# A specially crafted request could have crashed the Apache
# HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.30, due to an out of bound access after a
# size limit is reached by reading the HTTP header. This vulnerability is
# considered very hard if not impossible to trigger in non-debug mode (both log
# and build level), so it is classified as low risk for common server usage.
