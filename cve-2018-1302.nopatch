# low: Possible write of after free on HTTP/2 stream shutdown (CVE-2018-1302)
#
# When an HTTP/2 stream was destroyed after being handled, the Apache HTTP
# Server prior to version 2.4.30 could have written a NULL pointer potentially
# to an already freed memory.
# The memory pools maintained by the server make this vulnerabilty hard to
# trigger in usual configurations, the reporter and the team could not reproduce
# it outside debug builds, so it is classified as low risk.
